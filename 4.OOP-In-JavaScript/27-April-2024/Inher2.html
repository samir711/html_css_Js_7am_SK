Functional Inheritance
=> The process of creating a new object based on another object (exists) is called "Functional inheritance"

OR

=> The process of creating a new constructor based on another constructor (exists) is called "Functional Inh
ertiance"

=> Used to build the relationship between multiple constructors

=> Used to extending functionalities of existing constructor without modifying source code.

Constructor to build inheritance.

Syntax:

function Constructor(params) { // Parent

  Prop init
  Methods
}

function Constructor(params) { // Child

  Constructor.call()         or constructor.call(this, params)
  Prop init
  Methods
}

refvar = new Constructor();
=> By calling 1st constructor from 2nd constructor function using call()

call() is a predefine function, it's used to call parent constructor from child constructor to build 
inheritance.

Javascript supports 3 types of inheritnace, those are
1. Single Level
2. Multi level
3. Hierarchal
