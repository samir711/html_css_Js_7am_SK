     Looping Statements
     Set of instruction given to the interperter to execute until the condition become false is called loops.
     The basic purpose of the loop is minimum code repetition.

     The way of the repetition will be forming circle that's why repetition statements are called loops. Some 
     loops are available in Javascript which are given below.
    
     => while loop (top testing/entry level)
     => for loop
     => do-while (bottom testing/exit level)

     initvalue => Where the loop begins   i = 1;
     condition => When the loops end / stops  (i <= 10)
     stepping  => It repeate no of iterations
